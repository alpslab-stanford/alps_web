          Tony is a PhD student in Linguistics. He is interested in sociolinguistics, especially third-wave variationist work, and the intersection between social and semantic/pragmatic meaning, as well as exploring how an understanding of language as socially and cognitively embedded can provide paths forward in modelling language behavior. His current work focuses on Bayesian modelling of the impacts of social information on semantic interpretation.
