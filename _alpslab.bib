abstract = {World knowledge enters into pragmatic utterance interpreta- tion in complex ways, and may be defeasible in light of speak- ers' utterances. Yet there is to date a surprising lack of sys- tematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in prag- matic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the in- fluence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like Some of the marbles sank. We extend the model to cap- ture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners' in- terpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners' judgments of how â€˜normal' the world is in light of a speaker's statement. Theoretical and methodological implica- tions are discussed. Keywords:},

abstract = {The iterated best response (IBR) model is a game-theoretic approach to formal pragmatics that spells out pragmatic reasoning as back-and-forth reasoning about interlocutors' ratio-nal choices and beliefs (Franke, 2011; J{\"{a}}ger, 2011). We investigate the comprehension and production of referential expressions within this framework. Two studies manipulating the complexity of inferences involved in com-prehension (Exp. 1) and production (Exp. 2) of referential expressions show an intriguing asymmetry: comprehension performance is better than production in corresponding com-plex inference tasks, but worse on simpler ones. This is not predicted by standard formu-lations of IBR, which makes categorical pre-dictions about rational choices. We suggest that taking into account quantitative informa-tion about beliefs of reasoners results in a bet-ter fit to the data, thus calling for a revision of the game-theoretic model.},

abstract = {In the face of underspecified utterances, listeners routinely and without much apparent effort make the right kinds of pragmatic inferences about a speaker's intended meaning. This dissertation investigates the processing of scalar impli- catures as a way of addressing how listeners perform this remarkable feat. In particular, the role of context in the processing of scalar implicatures from some to not all is explored. Contrary to the widely held assumption that scalar impli- catures are highly regularized, frequent, and relatively context-independent, this dissertation suggests that they are in fact relatively infrequent and highly context- dependent; both the robustness and the speed with which scalar implicatures from some to not all are computed are modulated by the probabilistic support that the implicature receives from multiple contextual cues. Scalar implicatures are found to be especially sensitive to the naturalness or expectedness of both scalar and non-scalar alternative utterances the speaker could have produced, but didn't. A novel contextualist account of scalar implicature processing that has roots in both constraint-based and information-theoretic accounts of language processing is proposed that provides a unifying explanation for a) the varying robustness of scalar implicatures across different contexts, b) the varying speed of scalar implica- tures across different contexts, and c) the speed and efficiency of communication.},

abstract = {Linguistic meaning has long been recognized to be highly context-dependent. Quantifiers like many and some provide a particularly clear example of context-dependence. For example, the interpretation of quantifiers requires listeners to determine the relevant domain and scale. We focus on another type of context-dependence that quantifiers share with other lexical items: talker variability. Different talkers might use quantifiers with different interpretations in mind. We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants' expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure. We first established that the mapping of some and many onto quantities (candies in a bowl) is variable both within and between participants. We then examined whether and how listeners' expectations about quantifier use adapts with exposure to talkers who use quantifiers in different ways. The results demonstrate that listeners can adapt to talker-specific biases in both how often and with what intended meaning many and some are used.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.Two visual world experiments investigated the processing of the implicature associated with some using a "gumball paradigm." On each trial, participants saw an image of a gumball machine with an upper chamber with orange and blue gumballs and an empty lower chamber. Gumballs dropped to the lower chamber, creating a contrast between a partitioned set of gumballs of one color and an unpartitioned set of the other. Participants then evaluated spoken statements, such as "You got some of the blue gumballs." Experiment 1 investigated the time course of the pragmatic enrichment from some to not all when the only utterance alternatives available to refer to the different sets were some and all. In Experiment 2, the number terms two, three, four, and five were also included in the set of alternatives. Scalar implicatures were delayed relative to the interpretation of literal statements with all only when number terms were available. The results are interpreted as evidence for a constraint-based account of scalar implicature processing.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated the processing of the implicature associated with some using a "gumball paradigm." On each trial, participants saw an image of a gumball machine with an upper chamber with 13 gumballs and an empty lower chamber. Gumballs then dropped to the lower chamber and participants evaluated statements, such as "You got some of the gumballs." Experiment 1 established that some is less natural for reference to small sets (1, 2, and 3 of the 13 gumballs) and unpartitioned sets (all 13 gumballs) compared to intermediate sets (6-8). Partitive some of was less natural than simple some when used with the unpartitioned set. In Experiment 2, including exact number descriptions lowered naturalness ratings for some with small sets but not for intermediate size sets and the unpartitioned set. In Experiment 3, the naturalness ratings from Experiment 2 predicted response times. The results are interpreted as evidence for a Constraint-Based account of scalar implicature processing and against both two-stage, Literal-First models and pragmatic Default models.},
